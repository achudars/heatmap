heatmap
=======

Can I make a heatmap?

TODO

- [ ] circles need to increase in size when the cursor is idle (isIdle()???)
- [ ] circles need to change temperature when cursor is idle or has been within the area of similar coordinates for too long or over time
- [ ] add functionality to turn heatmap on and off
- [ ] add functionality to show/hide heatmap
- [ ] do a backwards salto
